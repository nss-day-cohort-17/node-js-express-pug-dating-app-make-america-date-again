# dating-app-group-project

Instructions

After months without any success in the dating app market, you decide to rebrand your app and build it from the ground up. Using all of your Express skills, you decided to create a server side app with user authentication, a PostgreSQL database, and PugJS for the view engine.

The home page for a user should list all available users profiles.

When a user first registers, they should be prompted to create a dating profile with personal information, likes and dislikes, etc.

A user should be able to browse all users and "like" a user who could be a potential date.

Create a page for a user to view all of their liked choices.

A user should be able to login and be taken to their home page.

Requirements

Before any code is written, use a organization tool to fully plan the project out.

Use Knex, Bookshelf and PostgreSQL for the database and database ORM.

Use pug as the view engine.

For session persistence be sure to use the following technologies: express-session, passport, passport-local, connect-session-knex.

Using bookshelf-bcrypt and bcrypt, authenticate user credentials on login and registration.
